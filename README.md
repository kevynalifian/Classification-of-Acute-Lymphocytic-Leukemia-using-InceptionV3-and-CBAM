# Classification of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia using InceptionV3 and CBAM

## Description:
Accurate classification of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is essential for timely diagnosis and treatment planning. This study presents a deep learning approach that integrates the InceptionV3 architecture with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance feature extraction and focus on relevant regions in medical images. InceptionV3 provides a robust multi-scale representation, while CBAM introduces spatial and channel-wise attention to refine the modelâ€™s focus. The combined model is trained on a dataset of ALL images and evaluated for classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the InceptionV3-CBAM framework achieves superior accuracy and sensitivity compared to baseline models, indicating its potential for reliable ALL diagnosis in clinical settings.
